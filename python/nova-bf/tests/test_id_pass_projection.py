"""The `tiebreak='id'` startup pass must not buy whole files for one column.

WHAT THIS GUARDS. `io_ranged_get` makes `read_columns` download the ENTIRE file
into a buffer and then parse the requested columns out of it. That is the right
trade for the vector scan, which wants most of a file's bytes. The id pass wants
one narrow column -- ~180 KB of a ~4.3 GB pubmed shard -- so taking the same
path bought 4.3 GB to keep 0.004% of it.

Measured on the 2026-09-22 pubmed GT run, at the pass's 32-way default:
  * ~137 GB of resident whole-file buffers, which Ray OOM-killed on all 16
    ranks at `0/500` -- before a single corpus vector had been scored; and
  * with the fan-out throttled to 4 to survive that, 1055 s per rank spent
    re-reading 2.15 TB of corpus for 1.5 M ids, with the GPU idle throughout,
    because `_await_ordinals()` joins the pass before the first ordinal fold.

So this is a memory AND a throughput regression guard, and neither shows up in
the pass's own output -- the ids are identical either way. Only the byte volume
differs, which is why these assert on HOW the read was issued rather than on
results.

WHY BOTH ASSERTIONS. Counting `_ranged_download` alone proves only that a code
path was not taken; it would still pass if a future edit dropped `columns` and
read whole files through the ordinary reader. So the id-pass read is also
checked to be a genuine single-column projection. The byte saving that buys is
a property of parquet, not of this repo: one contiguous column chunk per column
per row group, so a projected read fetches the footer plus that one chunk --
verified by strace on a one-row-group file as 3 preads / 1.24 MB against the
whole 104 MB. One row group costs PARALLELISM (see the `io.py` module comment),
not selectivity.

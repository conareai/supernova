"""`merge` must refuse partials that did not come from one complete run.

A search's partial directory is addressed by (queries stem, search name, k)
alone, so any two runs agreeing on those three write into it, and rank files
overwrite only the ranks the newer run has. The resulting mixtures merge
CLEANLY — the schema, the query rows and the hit-id shape are all identical —

such mixture on purpose and assert the merge refuses it.
